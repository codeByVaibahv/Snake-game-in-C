THESE CODES WILL ONLY WORK IN WINDOWS PLATFORM AS I HAVE USED WINDOWS LIBRARY FOR CHANGING SCREEN BUFFER.

In order to run the compile and run the game properly:-

SET YOUR CONSOLE FONT TO CONSOLAS.

SET YOUR FONT SIZE IN BETWEEN 5 AND 16.

LARGER THE FONT SIZE LARGER WILL BE YOUR SCREEN.

YOU HAVE TO SET IT MANNUALLY IN COMMAND PROMPT IN DEFAULTS -> FONT.

In order to use it you must enable C99 mode by passing -std=c99 before compiling (or some later standard) to GCC.

In Code::Blocks goto -> Settings -> Compiler and then check the box with option [-std=c99] or later.

OR Change the code to work with C89.

CHANGE THE CODE AS U LIKE.

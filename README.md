# Snake-game-in-C
Snake game in C using ASCII chars.

This is a Code::Block project.

In order to run the game properly:-

1. Change cmd font to consolas and font size to 16.

2. In order to use it you must enable C99 mode by passing -std=c99 before compiling (or some later standard) to GCC.
 
   In Code::Blocks goto -> Settings -> Compiler and then check the box with option [-std=c99] or later.
 
   OR
 
   Change the code to work with C89.

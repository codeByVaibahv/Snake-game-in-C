# Snake-game-in-C
Snake game in C using ASCII chars.

This is a Code::Block project.

## Note:

1. these codes will only work in windows platform as i have used windows library.
### In order to run the compile and run the game properly:-
2. set your console font to consolas.
3. set your font size in between 5 and 16.
   larger the font size larger will be your screen.
   you have to set it mannually in command prompt in defaults -> font.

4. In order to use it you must enable C99 mode by passing -std=c99 before compiling (or some later standard) to GCC.
 
   In Code::Blocks goto -> Settings -> Compiler and then check the box with option [-std=c99] or later.
 
   OR
 
   Change the code to work with C89.
